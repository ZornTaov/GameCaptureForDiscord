Game Capture Screen for Discord Screenshare
This project was born from the frustration of not getting a good and consistant video AND audio captured from console games on PC over Discord.  My Elgato got old and glitchy, and discord would only ever capture the video from OBS/Streamlabs, and not the audio consistantly.  Thus, I created my OWN capture program, one that outputs audio and video from the same window, and that is configureable to be able to choose the video device (newer game captures come up as a webcam), audio input device, AND audio output device for full customizability, as well as a volume slider if the direct feed from the console is too loud.

# Usage
* Download and Unzip the file for your version of OS from Releases.
* Run `GameCaptureForDiscord.exe`.
* Wait for it to load (takes around 30 seconds or more unfortunately).
* Select your video, input, and output devices.
* * Suggested output should be a different device you can mute, so you don't have to hear the delayed audio coming from the game capture device.
* * If the sound stops working, press Set Sound Devices.
* Start Capture.
* Tell Discord to to share the video capture window.
* Enjoy playing games for your friends!
